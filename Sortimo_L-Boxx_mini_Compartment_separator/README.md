# Sortimo L-Boxx mini Compartment separator

I got inspired by the design from [Shiftys_Woodwork](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4085402) which were not perfect in fit and finish and had a huge design flaw in my opinion.  
Small parts like m3 bolts and nuts were able to mix because the separators did not reach the lid.

Iâ€™ve completely designed the separators new, because of the non-symmetric lid there are 6 parts, one for each compartment.  
The separators are only half the compartment size to safe print time and filament, I used double-sided tape to secure the separators.  
The separators reach the lid, so nothing will get mixed.

Hint: The lettering is only visible in the slicer and will not be part of the final print :)
