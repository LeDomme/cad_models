#  VRGM VR Grips for Oculus Quest 2


I found no good Oculus Quest 2 Grips for the VRGM VR Stock, so I took two designs I liked and combined em.

Stock Plate Source: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4755718](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4755718)

You'll find three STL files, one is a standalone fixed version and the other two are a magnetic version (20x3mm magnet).  
The fixed version has a slit for the handstrap, so you can easily switch from controller only to stock and vice versa.  
The magnetic one has a hole for the handstrap and yes, it is big enough for adult size hands ;)

I've used the fixed version for my dominant hand and the magnet for my second hand.  
If you print the grips as they're, they will only fit the right controller, you'll need to mirror the models in your slicer.

## Print Settings
Supports: Yes
Notes: Smooth everything so its comfortable to touch.  
Add to the magnetic version the magnet (20x3mm), when needed with glue or as a pressure fit
